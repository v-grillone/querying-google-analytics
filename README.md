Leveraging the power of the SQL language in combination with python to analyze the google store data to draw interesting insights.

# About

In this notebook, I use Google's BigQuery to create multiple queries through the google analytics dataset based on the Google Store data. I will be using the information collected to answer key questions and make intuitive visualizations.

Some of the visualizations you will find in this notebook are:

Visits to the Google store per continent

Daily analysis of returning and new customers

The hour that received the most visits throughout the day

And more!
